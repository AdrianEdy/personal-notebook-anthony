![Jojo's Bizzare Adventure](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/40409.jpg "Jojo's Bizzare Adventure")
[MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14719/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_TV)
JoJo is based from Joestar Family stories where they family was corrupted some retard adopted children.
For my personal analysis, JoJo is fullfiled with action, an logical thinking and stories that blows your mind (Really Bizzare as its name lol)

NB : All of this list are based my personal preference.
