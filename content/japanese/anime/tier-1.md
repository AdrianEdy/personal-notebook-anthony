# This is my list of anime that overall is good but sometimes im kind of regret how the ended or they missing some kind little things (For my personal opinion)
## Gintama
![Gintama](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/73274.jpg "Gintama")

[Gintama](https://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) has a interesting story about samurai that wrapped with a lot of comedy and funny parody.
Gintama started with fellows samura who live on kabuki-chou that struggled for living because alien invasion.
If you love a comedy, you should watch this anime !
Despite the comedy, Gintama has a interesting and thrilling main story that progressing (slowly lol) in the anime.
Why i put this on Tier 1 ? The ending still hanged and i can't decide this anime yet to Tier 0, so i think i put this on Tier 1 for a while now. :D

![Shingeki No Kyojin](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47347.jpg "Shingeki No Kyojin")

[Shingeki No Kyojin](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin) starts with village (nation ?) that surrounded by walls for human surviving from titans. Titan is (human ?) on big size, idk how to explain, i'm scared spoiling it accidentally.
One day, Titan that really big crushed the wall and get through the wall.
I have think about it to Tier 0 but the story is still hangover so i placed it in here.
I really love both action and story, they were awesome !
You'll should watch it, you'll not regret it :D
