## Gintama
![Gintama](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/73274.jpg "Jojo's Bizzare Adventure")

[Gintama](https://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama) has a interesting story about samurai that wrapped with a lot of comedy and funny parody.
Gintama started with fellows samura who live on kabuki-chou that struggled for living because alien invasion.
If you love a comedy, you should watch this anime !
Despite the comedy, Gintama has a interesting and thrilling main story that progressing (slowly lol) in the anime.
Why i put this on Tier 1 ? The ending still hanged and i can't decide this anime yet to Tier 0, so i think i put this on Tier 1
