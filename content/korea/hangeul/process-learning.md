At the first, i was learning korean self-taught
It can be through duolingo, just random hangeul pdf, and so on.

at the first i just randomly remembering hangeul and write my friend's name lol.

and then i was using Pimsleur Korean [Pimsleur](https://www.pimsleur.com/) for training my speaking and remembering a few (much?) important vocab.
